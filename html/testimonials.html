              As a full-time mom of two and a new business owner, I was overwhelmed with choices. I didn’t even know what to ask for when it came to upgrading my web ordering system — but Stephen sat down with me in person and walked me through every part of it.

              He asked the right questions, explained the difference between relational and non-relational databases, and helped me realize exactly what I needed. My inventory is all over the place — handmade crafts, resale electronics, and beauty products — so Stephen built a backend that fit that mess perfectly.

              He even trained my two employees on how to use it — and they actually enjoyed it! I thought it was going to be all grayscale buttons and boring menus, but he made it look colorful, intuitive, and honestly kind of fun. I didn’t know software could be... cute? 😅

              Thanks to him, All Things You Want feels like it leveled up overnight. I’d hire him again in a heartbeat.

      <p class="card-text">My name’s Matthew, I’m 15, and I’ve been learning web development through a Udemy course my dad signed me up for. I understood some of it, but a lot of the JavaScript stuff just wasn’t clicking. My dad — he does woodworking out of our garage — tried to help the best he could, but we both knew I needed more support.

      He found Mr. Lewis through his LinkedIn, which led him to this site. Since Mr. Lewis said he helps students for free, we reached out. Even though he didn’t ask for anything, my dad still sent him $50 after the first session because of how much it helped.

      What I liked the most is Mr. Lewis didn’t just try to teach at me — he actually talked with me. He asked what I understood, where I was stuck, and then explained things in a way that made sense, especially using baseball analogies when he learned I liked it.

      He’d go off on what he calls “tangents” — but to me, that’s where I learned the most. We didn’t just follow the Udemy lessons. We’d go deeper. He showed me how to use something called DevTools, not just in the browser, but also places like MDN and DevDocs. Tools I didn’t even know existed.

      Even though we’ve only met online, it feels like he’s right there. Sometimes I’d be typing, listening to him walk me through code, and I’d literally glance over my shoulder — that’s how real it feels.

      We’ve met four times now — every weekend — and I hope we keep going. Mr. Lewis makes learning feel real. I look forward to our sessions.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Retired Engineer Turned Tinkerer</h5>
        <p class="card-text">                    I spent 30 years as an electrical engineer, and when I finally retired, I thought I’d finally have time to build all the ideas I’d shelved over the years. Trouble is, the world changed. Everything runs on code now. I know wiring, not web servers. Suddenly, my old toolkits didn’t work — and I was frustrated, overwhelmed, and close to giving up.

                        Then I met Stephen.

                        I stumbled onto his site after reading a post he’d shared about Cherry Optimism — a phrase that sounded corny until I read what he meant by it: choosing to be cheerful even when the world’s got teeth. That stuck with me.

                        I sent him a message expecting a delayed response or maybe a referral. Instead, I got a real person. We started chatting. I told him about my half-built project — a digital display I was trying to hook up for my garage workshop — and how I couldn’t figure out the back end.

                        Stephen didn’t talk down to me. He didn’t act like I was wasting his time. He just asked questions, took notes, and started walking me through things step by step. I asked dumb questions — often twice — and he never flinched. He told me, “You’re building something real, sir. Real things take time. Break it once, learn twice.”

                        It wasn’t just the code. It was the calm. The man shows up like a lighthouse. Even when we hit bugs or I hit walls, he kept his optimism — not in a loud way, but like a man who’s wrestled storms and just kept walking.

                        We still meet every now and then. Not just about code. Sometimes about life. I told him once that it’s rare these days to meet someone who believes in people just enough to be patient with them. He shrugged and said, “That’s how I learn too.”

                        So, if you’re reading this and you’re unsure, or you’ve got an idea and no clue where to start — start here. Start with Stephen. He knows the dark, but he chooses the light.</p>
